# About Track Hubs:

Track hubs are collections of experimental data, annotations, and a reference genome assembled in a format recognizable by the [UCSC Genome Browser](http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/). They are intended to make it easier for researchers to view tracks aligned to unsupported or uncommon genomes.

Track hubs were developed and described by Raney BJ, et al. in their [2014 Bioinformatics manuscript](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/30/7/1003/232409) PMID: 24227676.
